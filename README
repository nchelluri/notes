Notes in Bash

Quick Notes from the terminal, anywhere.

To install:

1. Move this folder (notes) to ~/bin
2. Create the directory ~/.notes
3. Add: "source ~/bin/notes/notes" (no quotes) to your ~/.bashrc file

Done!

Now from Terminal you can do:

notes          # to list all notes
new-note asdf  # to create a note named asdf
note as<TAB>   # to view the note named asdf
edit-note asdf # to edit the note named asdf

The End
